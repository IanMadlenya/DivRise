        netDebtToEBITDAs: "Measures a company's leverage and its ability to meet debt. The lower, when compared to its industry average, the better as it would take less for the company to pay its debt back. A ratio over 3 is usually not worth investing.",
        peRatios: "The lower the ratio, when compared to companies in the same sector, the more attractive the company's stock since you're paying less for $1 of its earnings. A ratio below 20 is worth investing.",
        dividendYields: "Stock's annual dividend payments, as a percentage of the share's current price. The greater the yield, the more value you are getting for buying a share.",

        dividendPerShares: "Take dividend yield and multiply it by the current share price to get DPS. The higher, the more direct income you get.",
        debtToEquitys: "Measures the degree to which a company is financing its operation through total liabilities versus shareholder equity. The lower the ratio, the lower the leverage, and thus the lower the risk. A ratio over 2 is usually not worth investing.",
        operatingProfitMargins: "Represents the company's earnings before interest and taxes. Higher and more stable margins are preferred as they help our earnings compound faster. It also could be a sign that the company has an economic moat.",
        debtToCapitalRatios: "Measure of how much interest bearing debt a company is using to finance its business. Useful because if a company fails, it pays debt first, then shareholders, and we want to know the risk. A ratio over 50% is usually not worth investing, unless it's utilities.",
        sharePrices: "Price of a single share of stock in the company. Generally, a good time to buy a stock is when its share prices are below historical averages and if you are confident that the stock will do well in the future."
